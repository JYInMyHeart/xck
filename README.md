a simple jvm wrote by java just for realize how jvm works.

It only has one useful command.

U can insert "classpath;className" to invoke this classFile

if the parameter "className" are some jdk's library's classFile.It can also be loaded and u can see some informations.

Note:
    1.This small toy only support jdk1.8 and u'd better already setting "JAVA_HOME" environment variable.Because the rootClassPath depends on jdk1.8's librarys.
Jdk1.9+'s catalogs are changed so it might not be able to loaded jdk's library.
    2.This toy only support very few features.U can use it do some simple computings.But don't use array.I haven't finish it.
    3.If u find some bugs about it.It's very appreciate if u can fix that.Also u can give a issue.But maybe i won't go to fix it.
